# Side-Scan-Sonar-detect
This is a multi-scale target detection method of side-scan sonar. Our method achieves high accuracy on multiple data sets such as mines, containers, shipwrecks, wrecked aircraft, pipelines, etc.
This method can be generalized as a training strategy for target detection network of side-scan sonar. Our method is discarded in the inference stage and does not increase the burden of network inference.
After our paper is accepted, we will publish all the code.
